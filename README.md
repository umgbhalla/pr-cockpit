# PR Cockpit

**GitHub pull requests at local speed.**

PR Cockpit is a keyboard-first macOS app that keeps pull requests, diffs, threads, checks, and images warm on your Mac. Reads feel immediate, while comments, reviews, edits, and merges sync through your existing `gh` login. GitHub remains the source of truth.

## GitHub PRs at local speed

The local server serves the queue and open pull request from SQLite instead of rebuilding every screen from GitHub. Webhook markers trigger targeted refreshes, WebSocket invalidations update the UI, and a poller repairs missed events.

Warm-cache opens of the large private pull request `scape-app/scape#8132`:

| Product | p50 | p95 | p99 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| PR Cockpit | 0.082 s | 0.112 s | **0.121 s** |
| Cursor Origin | 1.738 s | 3.702 s | 5.606 s |
| GitHub | 3.381 s | 4.880 s | 5.678 s |

A separate 12-run comparison of the common interactions, each a cold first open:

| Interaction | PR Cockpit p50 | GitHub p50 | Faster |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Open a PR | 0.020 s | 1.421 s | 71.8× |
| Open a diff | 0.041 s | 1.487 s | 36.2× |
| Search PRs | 0.049 s | 0.839 s | 17.1× |

At p99, PR Cockpit painted the same pull request **47× faster than GitHub**. [Methodology and reproduction](scripts/benchmark-ui.mjs).

## Search from anywhere

Press <kbd>⌥⌘K</kbd> from any app, type, <kbd>enter</kbd>. The full pull request opens from the local cache.

## One queue. Three lanes.

Ready to merge, your move, and waiting are separate lanes, already sorted by what needs attention. Stacked pull requests stay together. Checks, conflicts, unresolved threads, and review state are available without tab-hopping.

## Hide tests. See the change.

Press <kbd>x</kbd> to fold test files out of the diff. In `graphql/graphql-js#4692`, that leaves the one-line fix on screen.

## One key from review to change

The review stays in one context:

- <kbd>p</kbd> opens the pull request in the configured coding agent with the current review context.
- <kbd>e</kbd> edits the open file and commits the patch back to the pull request.
- **Revert hunk** removes one focused change instead of rewriting the file.
- <kbd>h</kbd> walks file history without leaving the review.

## Agents: listen, don't poll.

The installer adds the open-source `pr-cockpit` CLI. It reads the same local cache as the app, returns compact agent-shaped output, and revalidates only when that cache is stale.

```sh
pr-cockpit owner/repo#123                    # state, checks, unresolved threads
pr-cockpit owner/repo#123 --diff             # cached diff
pr-cockpit owner/repo#123 --file src/app.ts  # full file at the PR head
pr-cockpit owner/repo#123 --jobs             # cached queued, running, and completed jobs
pr-cockpit owner/repo#123 --logs [check]     # cached failed and cancelled logs
pr-cockpit resolve owner/repo#123 HANDLE     # resolve a review thread
pr-cockpit update                            # fast-forward and rebuild
```

Waiting on CI, review, or a new comment? Block on the local fingerprint instead of polling GitHub:

```sh
pr-cockpit listen owner/repo#123
```

`listen` blocks until substantive cached state changes — a push, check result, review, or comment — then prints only what changed. `--ci-only` and `--comments-only` narrow the wake signal.

## Under the hood

![GitHub webhooks reach the local PR Cockpit server through a relay; the server keeps SQLite and the UI warm and serves agents over CLI and API](docs/screenshots/landing-under-the-hood.png)

- **GitHub is authoritative.** The local database is a warm read model, not a fork of pull-request state.
- **The relay carries markers, not pull-request payloads.** It also carries compact Actions run and job state, including runner assignment, but never full pull-request payloads or job logs.
- **Writes stay authenticated.** Comments, reviews, edits, thread resolution, and merges use the existing GitHub CLI login.
- **Humans and agents share one cache.** The app uses WebSocket invalidations; the CLI and API expose the same refreshed state.
- **Self-hosting is one Worker.** Deploy the relay to Cloudflare, create a GitHub App, and connect its URL—no separate database, server, or tunnel. [Complete self-hosting guide](docs/self-host-relay.md).

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theolundqvist/pr-cockpit/main/scripts/bootstrap | bash
```

The installer checks macOS prerequisites, asks before installing anything, shows each stage, and opens the four-step setup. Only after installation succeeds does it optionally offer to teach local coding assistants to use the cache-aware CLI. Run `pr-cockpit update` to upgrade. A legacy private installation is replaced while local pull-request data and settings are preserved.

### Linux server (private remote access)

From a clone on the Linux host, install the loopback-only systemd user service:

```sh
./scripts/install-linux
```

The process always binds `127.0.0.1`. Never bind `0.0.0.0`, open TCP 4820 on a public or LAN interface, or use Tailscale Funnel.

Edit `~/.config/pr-cockpit/server.env`, then run `systemctl --user restart pr-cockpit.service`. To update the checkout and rebuild the UI without replacing that file, run `git pull && ./scripts/install-linux` again.

To publish that loopback port onto your tailnet, opt in with `COCKPIT_TAILSCALE_SERVE=1` in `server.env` (or pass it on first install) and restart. Cockpit runs the equivalent of `tailscale serve --bg --https=443 http://127.0.0.1:$PORT` and adds the node's MagicDNS HTTPS origin (`https://<hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net`) to the origin allowlist so the event socket and POSTs work. If `tailscale` is missing or Serve fails, the loopback server keeps running and logs the error.

For a name that stays put when the process moves hosts, also set `COCKPIT_TAILSCALE_SERVICE=pr-cockpit` (or `svc:pr-cockpit`). That runs `tailscale serve --service=svc:pr-cockpit --https=443 http://127.0.0.1:$PORT` and auto-allows `https://pr-cockpit.<tailnet>.ts.net`. Service hosts must be tagged (`tag:server`); a user-auth laptop cannot advertise a Service. If advertise fails for that reason, Cockpit logs it clearly and keeps loopback and classic Serve running. Never Funnel, never bind `0.0.0.0`.

When Serve or a Service is publishing, a tailnet peer that arrives with Tailscale identity headers (`Tailscale-User-Login` plus `Tailscale-Headers-Info`) and an `Origin` matching `X-Forwarded-Host` (or this tailnet's MagicDNS suffix) is trusted without a pre-listed origin. Funnel requests are rejected. LocalAPI WhoIs is a best-effort extra path for tagged clients that do not get identity headers; a user-level process often cannot open `tailscaled`'s socket, and that failure is never treated as a successful identify. Other mesh frontends such as Twingate or Cloudflare Access still need each exact browser origin in `COCKPIT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

From another machine, `pr-cockpit` still defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:$PORT`. Set `COCKPIT_ORIGIN=https://pr-cockpit.<tailnet>.ts.net` to talk to the Service (or node Serve) origin, or leave origin unset with `COCKPIT_TAILSCALE_SERVICE` set so the CLI discovers `https://<name>.<suffix>` after loopback health fails. `update` and replica health stay on loopback. Do not use Electron's `COCKPIT_URL` for this.

For SSH access, leave TCP port 4820 closed and tunnel it instead:

```sh
ssh -N -L 4820:127.0.0.1:4820 user@host
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:4820`. A replica can use the Serve origin instead of SSH: `COCKPIT_PROXY=https://hostname.tailxxxx.ts.net` or `pr-cockpit --use-as-proxy https://hostname.tailxxxx.ts.net`. SSH remains for hosts that are not on the tailnet.

For phone access without Serve, keep the loopback binding and put a mesh VPN in front of it. A VPN whose agent runs on the same host reaches `127.0.0.1:4820` directly, so nothing has to listen on a public address. With Twingate, install a Connector on the host and define a Resource with address `127.0.0.1`, an alias, and TCP restricted to port `4820`. Add each exact browser origin to the comma-separated `COCKPIT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` value in `server.env` (for example, `COCKPIT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://cockpit.example.internal:4820"`) and restart the service, because unsafe requests and the event socket reject untrusted origins.

## Start in four steps

1. Connect your existing GitHub CLI login.
2. Choose repositories.
3. Enable live updates.
4. Open the review queue.

Run **Settings → Run setup again** whenever you want to change repositories or live updates.
